# **Build Instructions**

### **WARNING** Building these .pyd's is a not as straightforward as opening visual studio code and compiling the source files, because some blender structs such as `struct Mesh` were not made to be as easily accessible from outside of blender source code, you will be forced to implement your code inside blender source itself, Â add additional CMake instructions, and then proceed to build your python libraries alongside the host software. **This implicitly means that your created binaries will be exclusive for the OS and blender version it was built upon!** Please find some instructions on how you can implement such code, and how to compile it below:

## 1 - Build blender

test

## 2 - Implement your code within blender source

test

## 3 - Build blender (again)

test

## 4 - Obtain and ship your binaries
